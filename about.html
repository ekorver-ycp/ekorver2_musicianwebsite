            <p>Out of the Pacific Northwest, somewhere in the Octagon!
               In a cave, in a patch of moss Underneath a rock, in a
               week for bacteria leeches, nature mutated the most dazzling
               human-sized preditors of evil-doers the world has ever known!
               Armed only with Donkey Bones Honey Bears and the mossy log tomb
               they traveled in. These marooned, masked marvels, land on the sandy
               beaches in search of Vitamin-C And a few thousand marbles. If you
               have their number, call them sometime! They are The Aquabats!
               <br> <br>
               Over the course of a twenty year career, The Aquabats have made a name for themselves in both the musical and comedic worlds;
               their matching costumes and masks, designed to look like those of a superhero, have added an extra dimension to their music and
               in particular their live performances - their alleged crime-fighting is a staple of the comedic aspect of their gigs. That’s not
               to say, though, that these alternative personas and the focus on comedy has been developed purely as a distraction from their music;
               they’ve proven their diversity over the past couple of decades, having orginally started out as an eight-piece playing ska-influenced
               material, and gradually going on to reinvent themselves as a new wave act. </p>

             <p>The current lineup includes two of the original members, frontman The M.C. Bat Commander and bassist Crash McLarson,
               as well as Jimmy the Robot on keyboards. With the additions of Ricky Fitness behind the drum kit and Eagle ‘Bones’ Falconhawk
               on guitar. The sophisticated development of their comedic characters mythology has spawned over the television series, ‘The Aquabats!
               Super Show!’, and is a major aspect of their live performances. Despite being called having conerts with "no frills" their athletic mock
               fights along with fire-breathing and flips from The M.C. BAT Commander are a few of the onstage antics that are signature to the Aquabats
               muscial adventures.</p>
